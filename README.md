## Introduction
_Kozakura,「小桜」,「こざくら」means "Little Cherry Blossom"._

The KZ-35 is a bottom mount keyboard based on the QAZ 35% layout. The project is intended to freely 3D-printable and a fun little project for those hand-wiring their first keyboard.

Both the KZ-35 and QAZ are 10.25u by 4u. On the 3rd row, instead of having 2* 1.5u keys on either side, the KZ-35 has a 1.25u key on the right-side with the rest filled out with 1u keys. By splitting the L-SHIFT and Z key, you can easily access the capital letters.

Currently on the 4th row, there are 2* 1u keys on both sides of the 6.25u spacebar, but I may decide to upload some variations in the future

The case is seamless and in one solid piece. No need for a top cover as the screws are hidden underneath the keycaps.

Underneath there is a large window to show off your hand-wiring work along with the Kozakura symbol. There are also indents for 8mm rubber dome bumpers.

Inside the case there is a stand for a Pro-Micro. The USB hole supports USB-C and micro-USB.

## TODO
- Draw a Waifu for the keebweebz.
- Make a build video showing the full process and sound-test. Upload to Youtube.
- Write a "Lessons learned" article documenting the information that I struggled to find in my research. This could pave the way for newcomers in the keyboard design space.
- Finish writing README.md
- Create aesthitically pleasing graphics to illustrate this page.
