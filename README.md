Special thanks to u/dahninja - Cheers for the 3D printing and prototyping. (TдT)

## Introduction
_Kozakura,「小桜」,「こざくら」means "Little Cherry Blossom"._

The KZ-35 is a bottom mount keyboard based on the QAZ 35% layout. The project is intended to freely 3D-printable and a fun little project for those hand-wiring their first keyboard.

Both the KZ-35 and QAZ are 10.25u by 4u. On the 3rd row, instead of having 2* 1.5u keys on either side, the KZ-35 has a 1.25u key on the right-side with the rest filled out with 1u keys. By splitting the L-SHIFT and Z key, you can easily access the capital letters.

Currently on the 4th row, there are 2* 1u keys on both sides of the 6.25u spacebar, but I may decide to upload some variations in the future

The case is seamless and in one solid piece. No need for a top cover as the screws are hidden underneath the keycaps.

Underneath there is a large window to show off your hand-wiring work along with the Kozakura symbol. There are also indents for 8mm rubber dome bumpers.

Inside the case there is a stand for a Pro-Micro. The USB hole supports USB-C and micro-USB.

## Materials
- Soldering Iron
- Insulation (Heatshrink, Polyimide/Electrical Tape)
- 35 Cherry MX Style Mechanical switches
- 35 1N4148 Diodes
- Rainbow Ribbon Cable
- Wires or Brass bars/tubing (Optional)
- 4* M2 Screws 8mm long.
- 4* Heat-set insert M2 Knurled nuts
- 8mm Rubber dome bumpers (for feet)
- 4* 4mmx1mmx1.5mm O-rings (Optional)
- Clear Tamiya Pla Plate
- Glue
- Double-sided tape or Hot-glue.

## TODO
### Current Priorities
- Make the case thinner.
- Reduce thickness of plate to 3mm to save on filament.
- Make the window cut-out at the bottom of the case look cute. (Thinking of chibi-angel wings)

### Stretch Goals
- Draw a Waifu for the keebweebz.
- Create a variant with support for 1100mah battery and a panel mounted ON/OFF switch for ZMK and Nice! nano.
- Create variant row 4 layouts.
- Make a build video showing the full process and sound-test. Upload to Youtube.
- Buy a **reliable** 3D printer.
- Write a "Lessons learned" article documenting the information that I struggled to find in my research. This could pave the way for newcomers in the keyboard design space.
