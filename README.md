## Introduction
_Kozakura,「小桜」,「こざくら」means "Little Cherry Blossom"._

The KZ-35 is a bottom mount keyboard based on the QAZ 35% layout. The project is intended to freely 3D-printable and a fun little project for those hand-wiring their first keyboard.

The case is seamless and in one solid piece. No need for a top cover as the screws are hidden underneath the keycaps.

Underneath there is a large window to show off your hand-wiring work along with the Kozakura symbol. There are also indents for 8mm rubber dome bumpers.

Inside the case there is a stand for a Pro-Micro. The USB hole supports USB-C and micro-USB.

## Layout Comparison between KZ-35 and QAZ
Both layouts are 10.25u in width by 4u in depth. Currently I am trying to find a way to make certain keys optional without leaving an empty key-hole.

## TODO
- Draw a Waifu for the keebweebz.
- Make a build video showing the full process and sound-test. Upload to Youtube.
- Write a "Lessons learned" article documenting the information that I struggled to find in my research. This could pave the way for newcomers in the keyboard design space.
- Finish writing README.md
- Create aesthetically pleasing graphics to illustrate this page.
